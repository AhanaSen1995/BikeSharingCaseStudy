## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
